# Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

def main():
    iNumber = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    divisors = []

    for i in range(1,iNumber + 1):
        if iNumber % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
    strDivisors = ', '.join(map(str, divisors))
    print("Divisors of the given number: [" + strDivisors + "]")

main()
